# Fish-Base-Shiny-App
rfishbase Shiny Application

This is a shiny application designed to go with the rfishbase and robis packages. The application is still in beta, and I need to complete the following:

  1) Opening page welcome modal
  2) Work Cited/Acknowledgements
  3) Stylized PDF downloads (and contitional chunks in the report.Rmd file)
  4) Add more, relevant, information for each fish
  5) Limit redundancys in code to speed up app
  6) Add FAO area tiles to maps where no occurance data is available

To run the app locally, you need to download the app.R, helpers.R, background-locations.RDS, report.Rmd, and the www folder. Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions/additions.
